# Book Recommender System Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Book Recommender System using machine learning techniques. The system suggests books to users based on their selection or input. It employs a k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model to find books similar to the user's chosen book.

## Overview

The Book Recommender System utilizes a dataset containing book information, including titles, ratings, and images. Users can select a book from the available options, and the system will provide recommendations based on the selected book's characteristics and user preferences.

## Dependencies

To run the Book Recommender System, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Streamlit
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy scikit-learn
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Book-Recommender-System-Using-Machine-Learning
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

5. Select a book from the dropdown menu and click the "Show recommendation" button to view recommended books based on your selection.

## Files and Structure

- `app.py`: Contains the main code for the Streamlit web application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the dependencies required to run the application.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- `kaggleBookDataSet/`: Directory containing artifacts and dataset files.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains book information, including titles, ratings, and images. The recommender system analyzes this data to provide personalized book recommendations to users.
